# Influence-Maximization
Code and data for experiments with evolutionary influence maximization

## Refactoring
- one file called "load" that contains everything related to loading functions
- one file called "spread" that contains all functions that evaluate influence spread over the network (simulation, lazy_fitness_evaluation, all approximations that do not really work)
